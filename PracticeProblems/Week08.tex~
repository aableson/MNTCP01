% ******************************
\item 
  \begin{Question}
    
Consider the single spring/mass system shown below, with no damper:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/SpringNoDampingWithFext}
\end{center}
where $\Fext$ is an external applied force.

Newton's second law gives us the relationship:
\begin{align*}
ma & = \sum F = \Fspring + \Fext \\
m x'' & = -k x + \Fext 
\end{align*}
where $k$ is the spring constant.

\begin{enumerate}
\item By hand, write this second order DE as a system of 1st order
  DEs, using the new variables $w_1 = x$ and $w_2 = x'$

\item Write a MATLAB function file called \verb#springDE1.m# starting
  with the first line \\
\verb#function dw_dt = springDE1(t, w, m, k)# \\
  that implements the system of differential equations from part (a).

  For this function, {\bf only include the spring force}, leaving the
  $F_{\mbox{ext}}$ = 0 or absent.

\item Create a new MATLAB script.  In the script, set $m =0.5$ kg, $k =
  10$ N/m. Use \verb#ode45# to simulate the motion of the spring,
  given an initial displacement of $x(0) = 0.2$ m, and initial
  velocity of zero: $x'(0) = 0$.  Generate a plot with
\begin{itemize}
\item position against time (do {\em not} show the velocity), and
\item choosing the time interval used for the \verb#ode45# simulation
  to show the first 4 to 5 cycles only.
\end{itemize}

\item We will now incorporate an external force of the form
  $F_{\mbox{ext}} = a \sin(b t)$. Write a MATLAB function file called
  \verb#springDE2.m# starting with the first line \\
  \verb#function dw_dt = springDE2(t, w, m, k, a, b)# \\
that implements
  the system of differential equations from part (a), now with the
  external force included.

\item Create a new MATLAB script.  In the script, again set $m =0.5$
  kg, $k = 10$ N/m, and use $a = 5$ and $b = 1$ in $F_{\mbox{ext}} = a
  \sin(bt)$.  Use \verb#ode45# to simulate the motion of the spring
  for 30 seconds (\verb#tspan = [0, 30]#), given an initial
  displacement of $x(0) = 0.2$ m, and initial velocity of zero: $x'(0)
  = 0$. \label{forced}

\item Explain why the motion looks so disorganized.

\item Repeat Question (\ref{forced}), but with an external force of
  $\Fext = \sin(4 t)$. Explain why the motion in this case has cyclic
  waves in its amplitude.


\end{enumerate}
  \end{Question}

\begin{Solution}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item  The first-order system would be:
 \begin{align*}
 \frac{d}{dt} w_1 & = x' = w_2 \\
 \frac{d}{dt} w_2 & = x'' = \frac{1}{m} \left(-kx + \Fext\right) = \frac{1}{m} \left(-k w_1  + \Fext \right)
 \end{align*}

\item The function file  
  \href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/springDE1.m}{springDE1.m} 
  implements the differential equation system, with the $\Fext $ term
  left out.

\item The main script
\href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/W08SpringSimulation01.m}{W08SpringSimulation01.m} 
has the code that will run this simulation.

In the resulting plot, we see a very nice example of simple harmonic
motion.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/W08SpringSimulation01}
\end{center}

\item The file  
  \href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/springDE2.m}{springDE2.m} 
  implements the differential equation system, with new external force
  $\Fext = a \sin(bt)$.
\item The file 
\href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/W08SpringSimulation02.m}{W08SpringSimulation02.m} 
has the code that will run this simulation.

In the resulting plot, see some wildly varying and irregular
oscillations.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/W08SpringSimulation02}
\end{center}

\item The motion of the mass looks very disorganized because the
  natural frequency (the frequency at which the mass would oscillate
  if you just let swing on its own) is different from the frequency
  that we are pushing and pulling on it with through $\Fext$.

  Recall: the natural frequency of a spring/mass system is given by
  $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$, which for this scenario gives $\omega =
  \sqrt{10/0.5} \approx 4.47$ rad/s.

\item 
The file 
  \href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/W08SpringSimulation02.m}{W08SpringSimulation02.m} 
  has the code that will run this simulation.  Here is a graph of the
  resulting mass motion.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/W08SpringSimulation03}
\end{center}

In the plot, we see
  that the natural frequency and the regular stimulation by the
  outside force are close to each other: the natural frequency is
  $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{10}{0.5}} \approx 4.5$, rad/s, and the
  stimulating frequency is at $\omega = 4$ rad/s.  This close match of
  the frequencies leads to the phenonenon called {\em beats}, or {\em
    near resonance}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Solution}



% ******************** Newton's Cooling  ********************************
\item 
\begin{Question}
Newton's law of heating and cooling states that an object with
  temperature $T$ in an environment at temperature $T_{ext}$ will heat
  up or cool down according to the differential equation

 $$\frac{dT}{dt} = -k (T - T_{ext})$$

 Consider a garage used as a workshop.  Its insulation and surface
 area give $k$ a value of 0.1, if time $t$ is measured in hours and
 the temperatures, $T$ and $T_{ext}$, are in degrees Celsius.

The temperature outside changes during the day, as described by
the formula 
$$T_{ext} =  10 + 7 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12} t\right)$$

We now imagine that the power goes out, with the garage at 23$^o$ C at
$t=0$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use ode45 and the DE to generate a numerical prediction of the
  garage's temperature $T$ over time.  Graph the solution over a time
  interval that shows both the initial and long-term behaviour of the
  temperature.

  In your script, try to use the functions \verb#title#,
  \verb#xlabel#, \verb#ylabel#, and \verb#legend# to annotate the
  graph to make it easier for a reader to understand.

  For the following questions, just use the graph or the numerical
  prediction of the temperature. You are {\em not} expected to solve
  the DE analytically.

\item How many days does it take for the garage to get into a
  consistent temperature cycle?  (You will need to estimate this by
  eye.)

\item How many degrees does the temperature in the building fluctuate
  by, once the temperature gets into a steady cycle?

\item Suppose the building were better insulated, so that the rate of
  heat loss were cut in half.  Should $k$ be half as large, or twice
  as large?  

\item Generate a numerical prediction for the temperature over time in
  the better-insulated scenario, and produce a graph of the
  temperature vs time for both scenarios on the same axes.
  
\item How large are the temperature fluctuations in the building, now
  that the extra insulation has been added?  Does halving the net heat
  flow also halve the net temperature fluctuations?
\end{enumerate}
  
\end{Question}

\begin{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  A graph of the temperature over time is shown below: 
  
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/W08GarageTemp_1}

The file 
  \href{http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~apsc171/MNTCP01/PracticeProblems/MATLAB/W08GarageTemp.m}{W08GarageTemp.m} 
has the MATLAB code that generated the graph above.

\item From the graph, it takes the building roughly 2 days (48 hours)
  to get into a repeating cycle of temperature variation.

\item Careful zooming of the graph (or a look at the $y$ values in the
  ode45 output) give a highest temperature of 12.5 (high) and 7.5
  (low), for a net fluctuation of approximately 2.6 degrees per day.

\item $k$ represents the coefficient of heat flow between the building
  and the environment. The bigger $k$ is, the {\em larger} the
  headflow between the two.  Since we're adding insulation, this
  should {\em reduce} the heat flow, and so {\em lower} the value of
  $k$.

\item A graph of the heat change over time, given better insulation,
  is shown below.

  \includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/Week08_Spring/W08GarageTemp_2}

\item Zooming in on the peaks of the graph, the temperature now
  fluctuates between approximately 11.3 and 8.8 degrees Celsius, for a
  range of 2.5 degrees.  This {\em is} roughly half the magnitude of
  the fluctuations we saw earlier.

\end{enumerate}

% \item 
% \begin{Question}
% For a spring/mass system with $m=1$ kg, $c=6$ N/(m/s), and
%   $k=45$, approximately what frequency of external forcing would
%   produce the largest amplitude steady-state vibration?
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
%   The natural frequency is found using the auxiliary equation $r^2 +
%   6r + 45 = 0$, giving $r=-3 \pm 6i$, so $x_c = c_1 e^{-3t}\cos(6t) +
%   c_2 e^{-3t} \sin(6t)$

% Since this system's natural or intrinsic oscillations are at 6 rad/s,
% the spring/mass will show the largest amplitude response to an outside
% force if that outside force also has a frequency close to 6 rad/s.

% \end{Solution}

% %****************
% \item 
% \begin{Question}
% For a spring/mass system with $m=1$ kg, $c=10$ N/(m/s), and
%   $k=650$, approximately what frequency of external forcing would
%   produce the largest amplitude steady-state vibration?
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
% $m=1, c=10,k=650,F_0=100$, so
% $$x'' + 10x' + 650x = \cos(\omega t)$$ 

% The natural frequency is found using the auxiliary equation $r^2 + 10r
% + 650 = 0$, giving $r=-5 \pm 25i$, so $x_c = c_1 e^{-5t}\cos(25t) +
% c_2 e^{-5t} \sin(25t)$

% It will show its largest amplitude response to stimuli with
% frequencies close to 25 rad/s.
% \end{Solution}

% %**********  
% \item \begin{Question}
% Consider the undamped spring model $y'' + \omega_0^2 y = \cos(\omega t)$.
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Solve $y'' + \omega_0^2 y = \cos(\omega t)$ where $\omega^2
%       \neq \omega_0^2$.
%     \item What does this predict will happen to the amplitude of the
%       oscillations as the stimulus frequence $\omega$ is brought
%       closer and closer to the natural frequency $\omega_0$?
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
%   \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%   \item 
%   The characteristic equation is $r^2+ \omega_0^2 = \bigl( r - \omega_0
%   \sqrt{-1}\bigr) \bigl( r + \omega_0 \sqrt{-1}\bigr)$, so the general solution
%   to the corresponding homogeneous equation is $C_1 \cos( \omega_0 t) + C_2
%   \sin(\omega_0 t)$.  Using the method of undetermined coefficients, we consider
%   a solution of the form $y_g(t) := A_1 \cos(\omega t) + A_2 \sin(\omega t)$ for
%   some constants $A_1$ and $A_2$.  It follows that
%   \begin{align*}
%     \cos(\omega t) &= y_g'' + \omega_0^2 y_g = \bigl( - A_1 \omega^2 \cos(\omega
%     t) - A_2 \omega^2 \sin( \omega t) \bigr) + \omega_0^2
%     \bigl(A_1 \cos(\omega t) + A_2 \sin(\omega t) \bigr) \\
%     &= (\omega_0^2-\omega^2) \bigl( A_1 \cos(\omega t) + A_2 \sin(\omega t)
%     \bigr)
%   \end{align*}
%   Since $\ds A_1 = \tfrac{1}{\omega_0^2 -\omega^2}$ and $A_2 = 0$, the general
%   solution is 
%   \[
%   C_1 \cos( \omega_0 t) + C_2 \sin(\omega_0 t) + \frac{1}{(\omega_0^2
%   -\omega^2)}\cos(\omega t) \, . \qedhere
%   \]
% \item As the stimulus frequency $\omega$ approaches the natural
%   frequency $\omega_0$, the amplitude given by $\frac{1}{(\omega_0^2 -
%     \omega^2)} \to \infty$.  This corresponds to the result of
%   resonance, when $\omega = \omega_0$, and the solutions change to
%   $y_c = A t \cos(\omega t)$, which has an linearly growing
%   (unbounded) amplitude.
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{Solution}
%   \vspace*{0.5em}

% %****************
% \item 
%   \begin{Question} 
% Consider the equation for the spring/mass system
%     with $m=1$ kg, $c=4$ N/(m/s) and $k = 4$ N/m, and which is being
%     forced by an external periodic force of $10 \cos(3t)$ N: $$x'' +
%     4x' + 4x = 10 \cos(3t)$$ Find the formula for the steady-state
%     oscillations, and find their amplitude.
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
%   The system is damped, so the $x_c$ solution will have negative
%   exponentials in it. i.e. that part of the solution will be {\bf
%     transient} because its contribution $\to 0$ over time.  That is
%   why $x_c$ is referred to as $x_{\mbox{transient}}$ or
%   $x_{\mbox{tr}}$ throughout the problems in this section.

%   Since the RHS is pure cos/sine, its differential family will not
%   overlap with the exp sin/cos in $x_c$.  This means $x_p$ will be a
%   simple linear combination of $\cos(3t)$ and $\sin(3t)$.

% Let $x_p = A \cos(3t) + B \sin(3t)$. \\
% $x_p' = -3A \sin(3t) + 3B \cos(3t)$ \\
% $x_p'' = -9A \cos(3t) - 9B \sin(3t)$ \\

% Substituting into the DE,
% $$ ( -9A \cos(3t) - 9B \sin(3t))
% +4( -3A \sin(3t) + 3B \cos(3t))
% +4(A \cos(3t) + B \sin(3t))  = 10 \cos(3t)$$ 
% \begin{align*}
% \mbox{sine coeffs: ~~~} -9B-12A+4B & = 0 & -12A -5B &= 0 \\
% \mbox{cos coeffs: ~~~} -9A+12B+4A & = 10 & -5A + 12B &= 10\\
% \\
% -60A -25B & = 0 \\
% -60A + 144 B &= 120 \\
% \\
%  -169B &= -120 \\
% \end{align*}


% Solving gives $\ds A = \frac{-50}{169}, B = \frac{120}{169}$, so 

% $$x_p = x_{sp} = \frac{-50}{169} \cos(3t) + \frac{120}{169} \sin(3t)$$

% The amplitude of the sum $A \cos(bt) + B \sin(bt)$ is given by $C =
% \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$, so the amplitude here is $\ds \sqrt{
%   \left(\frac{-50}{169}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{120}{169}\right)^2}
% \approx 0.77$ meters or 77 cm.

% \end{Solution}

% %********** 
% \item 
% \begin{Question}
%   Consider the equation for the spring/mass system 
% $$x'' + 3x' + 5x = 4 \cos(5t)$$ 
% Find the formula for the steady-state oscillations, and find their
% amplitude.
% \end{Question}
% \begin{Solution}
  
%   Again, because there is damping, $x_c$ will have negative
%   exponentials, and will fade away with time (transient part of the
%   solution).  Also, there is no overlap between the functions in the
%   transient $x_c$ and steady-state $x_p$, so we can set the form of $x_p$ as a
% linear combination of $\cos(5t)$ and $\sin(5t)$.

% Let $x_p = A \cos(5t) + B\sin(5t)$ so\\
% $x_p' = -5A \sin(5t) + 5B\cos(5t)$\\
% $x_p'' = -25A \cos(5t) - 25B\sin(5t)$\\

% Substituting into the DE,
% $$ ( -25A \cos(5t) - 25B \sin(5t))
% +3( -5A \sin(5t) + 5B \cos(5t))
% +5(A \cos(5t) + B \sin(5t))  = 4 \cos(5t)$$ 
% \begin{align*}
% \mbox{sine coeffs: ~~~} -25B-15A+5B & = 0 & -15A -20B &= 0 \\
% \mbox{cos coeffs: ~~~} -25A+15B+5A & = 4 & -20A + 15B &= 4\\
% \\
% -60A -80B & = 0 \\
% -60A + 45 B &= 12 \\
% \\
%  -125B &= 12 \\
% \end{align*}
% Solving gives $\ds A = \frac{16}{125}, B = \frac{-12}{125}$ so
% $$x_p = x_{sp} = \frac{16}{125} \cos(5t) - \frac{12}{125}\sin(5t)$$

% The amplitude of the sum $A \cos(bt) + B \sin(bt)$ is given by $C =
% \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$, so the amplitude here is $\ds \sqrt{
%   \left(\frac{16}{125}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-12}{125}\right)^2} =
% 0.16$ m, or 16 cm.

% \item 
% \begin{Question}
% The charge at a point in an electrical circuit is called
%   $Q(t)$. For a particular series circuit with a resistor, a
%   conductor, and a capacitor, $Q(t)$ satistifies the differential
%   equation
% $$ 2 Q'' + 60 Q' + 1/0.0025 Q = 100 e^{-t}$$
% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% \item Given the initial conditions that $Q(0) = 0$, $Q'(0) = 0$, 
% find the particular solution for $Q(t)$.
% \item Knowing that $I = Q'$ is the current in the circuit, find an
%   expression for $I(t)$.
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
%   \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%   \item \underline{Solving for $Q_c$}, we solve $2 r^2 + 60r + 400 = 0$, for $r = -20, -10$

% $$Q_c = c_1 e^{-20t} + c_2 e^{-10t}$$

% \underline{Solving for $Q_p$}, we assume $Q_p = A e^{-t}$.  Subbing
% into the DE gives $2 A - 60 A + 400A = 100$ or $A = 100/342 = 50/171$.

% $$Q_p = \frac{50}{171} e^{-t}$$

% This gives the general solution 
% $$Q = Q_c + Q_p = c_1 e^{-20t} + c_2 e^{-10t} + \frac{50}{171} e^{-t}$$

% Solving for $c_1$ and $c_2$ given $Q(0) = 0$ and $Q'(0) = 0$, gives
% \begin{align*}
%   0 & = c_1  + c_2 + \frac{50}{171} \\
%   0 & = -20c_1 -10 c_2 - \frac{50}{171}\\
% \end{align*}
% Solving gives $c_1 = 45/171 = 5/19$, $c_2 = -95/171 = -5/9 $, so
% $$Q = \frac{5}{19} e^{-20t} + \frac{-5}{9} e^{-10t} + \frac{50}{171}e^{-t}$$

% \item Differentiating $Q(t)$ to find $I$ we obtain
% $$ I = \frac{-100}{19} e^{-20t} + \frac{50}{9} e^{-10t} - \frac{50}{171} e^{-t}$$

% \begin{Question}
% A cantilevered beam which is $L = 2$ m long, made out of a pine ``2 by 4'' has \\
%   $I = 2.23 \times 10^{-6}$ m$^4$,\hspace{0.5in} $E = 9.1 \times
%   10^{9}$ N/m$^2$, and its deformation satisfies the differential
%   equation
% $$ EI y^{(4)} = p(x)$$
% where $p(x)$ is the loading on the beam in N/m, and boundary
% conditions $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 0$, $y''(2) = 0$, and $y'''(2) = 0$.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Find the formula for $y(x)$ if the load applied is {\em
%     triangular} (increases linearly), given by $p(x) = 20 x$ N/m.
%   I.e. as $x$ increases, moving away from the mounting point of the
%   beam, the load increases, until at the tip of the beam ($x=2$), the
%   load is 40 N/m.
% \item Find the amount of deflection of the beam at the tip under this
%   load.
% \end{enumerate}
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{w05_triangular_load}
% \end{center}
% \end{Question}

% \begin{Solution}
%   \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%   \item 
%   Since the corresponding homogeneous DE is simply $E Iy^{(4)} = 0$, with
%   roots to the characteristic equation of zero (repeated four times),
%   $y_c = c_1 + c_2 x+ c_3 x^2 + c_4 x^3$.
  
%   Since the RHS = $20 x$, $y_{p}$ would usually have been $A + Bx$.
%   However, this is not linearly independent with the functions in
%   $y_c$, so we boost by powers of $x$ until it is, so we choose
%   $y_p = A x^4 + Bx^5$.
  
%   Subbing $y_p$ into the DE and solving for $A$ and $B$,
%   \begin{align*}
%    EI \left(\underbrace{24 A + 120 Bx}_{y^{(4)}}\right) & = 20 x  \\
% \mbox{const coeff's: ~~~} A & = 0 \mbox{ and } \\
% \mbox{$x$ coeff's: ~~~} 120 EI B = 20, \mbox{ or } B & = \frac{1}{6 EI} \\
% \mbox{ so } y_P & =  \frac{1}{6 EI} x^5
%   \end{align*}

% This means the general solution is 
% $$y = \underbrace{c_1 + c_2 x+ c_3 x^2 + c_4 x^3}_{y_c} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{6EI} x}_{y_p}$$
% To solve for $c_1, \ldots, c_4$, we use the boundary conditions.
% \begin{align*}
% y(0)  = 0  \implies  0 & = c_1 \\
% y'(0)  = 0  \implies  0 & = c_2 \\
% y''(2)  = 0 \implies 0 & = 2 c_3 + 6 c_4 (2) + \frac{1}{6 EI} 20 (2)^3 \\ 
% y'''(2)  = 0 \implies 0 & = 6 c_4  + \frac{1}{6 EI} 60 (2)^2  
% \end{align*}
% Solving gives $\ds c_4 = \frac{-20}{3 EI}$ and $\ds c_3 = \frac{80}{3 EI}$, so the particular 
% solution, or the formula for the beam deflection at $x$ is 
% $$y = \frac{1}{EI} \left(\frac{80}{3} x^2 - \frac{20}{3} x^3 + \frac{1}{6} x^5\right)$$ 
% \item The deflection at the tip, $x=2$, is simply the value of $y(2)$:
% $$y(2) = \frac{1}{EI} \left(\frac{80}{3} 2^2 - \frac{20}{3} 2^3 + \frac{1}{6} 2^5\right) \approx 0.00289$$ 
% This means the tip of the beam deflects by 0.00289 m or roughly 3 mm
% under this load.

% \item \begin{Question}
% The \define{Bessel equation} of order one-half $x^2 y'' + xy ' +
%   \bigl(x^2- \tfrac{1}{4} \bigr) y = 0$ has two linearly independent solutions
%   $y_1(x) = x^{-1/2} \cos(x)$ and $y_2(x) = x^{-1/2} \sin(x)$.  Find a general
%   solution to the nonhomogenous equation $x^2 y'' + xy ' + \bigl(x^2-
%   \tfrac{1}{4} \bigr) y = x^{5/2}$ where $x>0$.
