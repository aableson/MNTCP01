\subsection*{Second and Higher Derivatives}


A lot of information about the graph of a function $f$ can be deduced
by the sign of $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$ (the {\bf second derivative} of
$f(x)$) on an interval $(a,b)$.

\topic{Taylor Polynomials}
\subsection*{Taylor Polynomials}

One application of higher derivative information is to help us build
{\bf polynomial approximations} to other functions.

Previously we found a formula for linear approximations to functions
$f(x)$ around a point $x=a$:

\vspace{1.5in}

This linear approximation, or tangent line formula, can also be called
the {\bf Taylor polynomial of degree 1 approximating $f(x)$ near
  $x=a$.}

\newpage

\problem Sketch the graph of $\cos(x)$ around $x=0$, and add its
tangent line based at $x=0$.

\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/empty_graph_square_12}


The linearization or tangent line is clearly a very
  limited approximation to this function.  What might be a {\em
    slightly} more complex form of function that would work better in
  this case?

\end{boxnote}

approximation will be a better or worse approximation than the tangent
line?  Why?

\topic{Critical Points}

\subsection*{Critical Points} 

Aside from understanding the shape of functions, derivative
information can help us identify and classify interesting points of a
function, like the highest and lowest values.

\problem Sketch graphs which have high and low points.  

\vfill 

What do those extreme values have in common?


\newpage

To help identify local extreme values, we introduce the definition of
a critical point.

\begin{boxnote}

  If $f(x)$ is defined on the interval $(a,b)$, then we call a point
  $c$ in the interval a {\bf critical point} if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f'(c) = 0$, or
	\item $f'(c)$ does not exist.
\end{itemize}
We will also refer to the point $(c,f(c))$ on the graph of $f(x)$ as a
critical point.  We call the function value $f(c)$ at a critical point
$c$ a {\bf critical value}.

\vsc
\end{boxnote}

\newpage

Technical Notes:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item By this definition, $f(c)$ must be {\bf defined} for
  $c$ to be a critical point.  

\problem   Sketch $f(x) = 1/x$, and decide whether $x=0$ is a
    critical point.

\vfill

\item By the definition, if a function is defined on a closed
  interval, the endpoints of interval {\bf cannot} be critical points.

\section*{Classifying Critical Points}

We will now formalize two ways to determine if a critical point is a
local min, max, or neither. This avoids the need for a sketch of the
graph. \\[2ex]
\newpage
{\bf First Derivative Test}

One indicator of the type of critical points is the sign of the
derivative on each side of the critical point.  This classification
method is called the {\bf{first derivative test}}.

\begin{boxnote}
{\bf Second Derivative Test}

You may also use the Second Derivative Test to determine if a critical
point is a local minimum or maximum.  
\begin{itemize}
\item The first derivative test uses the {\bf first} derivative {\bf
    around} the critical point.
\item The second derivative test uses the {\bf second} derivative {\bf at} the critical point.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f'(c)$ = 0 and $f''(c) > 0$ then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$. \\[2ex]
\item If $f'(c)$ = 0 and $f''(c) < 0$ then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$. \\[2ex]
\item If $f'(c)$ = 0 and $f''(c) = 0$ then the test is inconclusive. \\[2ex]

\newpage 

\topic{Global vs. Local Optimization}
\section*{Global vs. Local Optimization}

The first and second derivative tests only give us {\em local}
information in most cases.  However, if there are multiple local
maxima or minima, we usually want the {\bf global} max or min.  The
ease of determining when we have found the global max or min of a
function depends strongly on the properties of the question.

\begin{boxnote}

  \subsection*{Local vs Global Extrema}

  A {\bf local max} occurs at $x=c$ when $f(c) > f(x)$ for $x$ values
  near $c$.

  A {\bf global max} occurs at $x=c$ if $f(c) \ge f(x)$ for {\bf all}
  values of $x$ in the domain.  

  It is possible to have several global maxima if the function reaches
  its peak value at more than one point.

  Corresponding definitions apply for local and global minima.

\problem Give an example of a simple function with multiple global
  maxima.

\newpage Earlier we worked with the function $$f(x) = 2 x^3 -
  9 x^2 + 12 x +3.$$  
\problem If we limit the function to the interval $x \in
  [0, 2.5]$, what are the {\bf global max} and {\bf global minimum}
  values on that interval?

\newpage

\topic{Global Extrema on Closed and Open Intervals}

\begin{boxnote}
\subsection*{Global Extrema on Closed Intervals}

A continuous function on a closed interval will {\bf always} have a
global max and a global min value.  These values will occur at either
\begin{itemize}
\item a critical point {\em or}
\item an end point of the interval.
\end{itemize}
To find which value is the global extrema, you can compute the
original function's values at all the critical points and end points,
and select the point with the highest/lowest value of the function.

\end{boxnote}


\newpage
\begin{boxnote}
\subsection*{Global Extrema on Open Intervals}

A function defined on an open interval may or may not have global
maxima or minima.  
\vsc

If you are trying to demonstrate that a point is a global max or min,
and you are working with an open interval, including the possible
interval $(-\infty, \infty)$, proving that a particular point is a global
max or min requires a careful argument.  A recommendation is to look
at either:
\begin{itemize}
\item values of $f$ when $x$ approaches the endpoints of the interval,
  or $\pm \infty$, as appropriate; or
\item if there is only one critical point, look at the sign of $f'$ on
  either side of the critical point.
\end{itemize}
With that information, you can often construct an argument about a
particular point being a global max or min.

\topic{Optimization - Fencing Example}
\section*{Optimization}

An optimization problem is one in which we have to find the maximum or
minimum value of some quantity.  In principle, we already know how to
find the maximum and minimum values of a function if we are given a
formula for the function and the interval on which the maximum or
minimum is sought.  Usually the hard part in an optimization problem
is interpreting the word problem in order to find the formula of the
function to be optimized.

\topic{Optimization in MATLAB}
\subsection*{Optimization in MATLAB}

MATLAB has built-in numerical methods tools that can also perform
optimization, given the formula for a function.  However, those tools
have the same limitations as our earlier work with numerical methods
for solving equations.

These {\bf numerical methods} are all {\bf fancy versions of guess and
  check}!  This means numerical solutions are a poor second choice,
compared to by-hand solving:
\begin{itemize}
\item Numerical optimums give no insight into the optimal value
  (existence, patterns).
\item Finding numerical optimums usually requires some amount of trial
  and error by the user.
\end{itemize}

Despite these limitations though, numerical methods are great in that
they can be applied to any function, and don't require any by-hand
solving for critical points.
