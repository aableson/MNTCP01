\topic{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System Intro}
\section*{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System}

So far we have seen examples of {\bf first-order DEs}, or equations
with first derivatives of some unknown function.  

In the following examples, we will expand our study to differential
equations with {\bf second or higher derivatives}.

One classic source of differential equations of this type comes from
analyzing the forces on a block at the end of a spring.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_block}
\end{center}
\newpage
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_block}
\end{center}

While the mathematics behind this simple system will be very
interesting in their own right, we should also note at the outset that
the simple spring/mass model can be applied to a wide variety of
not-so-obviously related real-world problems.

\subsection*{Spring System Analysis}

In this system, how would you describe $x$ in words?

\newpage
\problem Draw a free-body diagram for the mass.  Indicate the magnitude of the forces, assuming 
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the block is $m$ kg, and
\item the spring constant (in $N/m$) is
  given by the constant $k$.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
Let us work with our intuition about this system before beginning the mathematics.

\problem If the spring is very stiff, is $k$ large or small?  \vfill

\newpage
{\bf Period}: the length of time to complete one full cycle/oscillation.
\vspace{0.2in}

\problem If we increase the stiffness of the spring, do you expect the
{\em period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease?  Why?

\vfill

If we increase the mass, do you expect
the \emph{period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease? Why?

\vfill

\newpage

\problem If we know $k$ and $m$, and assume that friction is
negligible, should we be able to determine the exact period of the
oscillations?  \vfill


\vfill

From the work so far, can we easily find the formula for the period?

\vfill

\newpage

The spring system is an excellent introduction to higher-order differential equations because 
\begin{itemize}
\item we all have an intuition about how it \emph{should} work physically,
\item the mathematics and physics are simple, and
\item there's no obvious way to predict critical features (e.g. the
  period) from the given information.
\end{itemize}
We clearly need some new tools!

\topic{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}
\section*{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}

We now consider an extension to the spring/mass system seen earlier

Consider a mass $m$ hanging on the end of a vertical spring; the
spring has a natural length corresponding to $x=0$.  

We have now added a damper, which exerts a force proportional to the
velocity of the oscillating mass.

\problem Using Newton's second law, build a differential equation that
governs the system.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Gravity acts downward and has a magnitude of $mg$ where $g$ is the
%   acceleration due to gravity; $F_g = mg$.
% \item The spring acts upward and, by Hooke's law, has a magnitude proportional
%   elongation.  If $y$ represents the displacement of the mass from the
%   equilibrium position, then $F_s = -k(\ell +y)$.
% \item Assuming that possible damping forces (i.e.\ a dashpot) are directly
%   proportional to the velocity of the mass, we have $F_d = - cy'$.
% \item There may be an external driving force $F(t)$.
% \end{itemize}
% Summing the forces, we find that $m y'' = F_g + F_s + F_d + F(t) = mg -k(\ell
% +y) -cy' + F(t)$.  At equilibrium, we have $mg = k\ell$ so the standard form of

\topic{Converting Higher-Order DEs to 1st Order Systems}
\subsection*{Converting Higher-Order DEs to 1st Order Systems}
To solve a higher-order DE using MATLAB, we need to convert it first
into a larger {\bf first-order system} of differential equations.


\vspace{0.3in}
Notation: In this section, 
\begin{itemize} 
\item vectors with be written vector hats, e.g. $\vec{x}$,
\item elements of a vector will be noted with subscripts, e.g. $w_1$,
  $y_2$, and
\item other scalars will be in lower-case, e.g. $c$, $\lambda$.
\end{itemize}

$$ x'' = -c x' -kx $$
\problem For the spring/mass DE, define a new vector of 2 variables,
$\vec{w}$, that will allow the conversion of the second-order system
to a first-order system.


\newpage
$$ x'' = -c x' -kx $$
\problem Define the derivative of $\vec{w}$ in terms of $\vec{w}$
itself, making use of the DE as necessary.

\vfill
\vfill

This is now a {\bf first-order system} of differential equations.  \\
The variable we are most interested in for this example is $w_1 = x$,
the {\em position} of the mass.

\newpage

{\bf MATLAB Function Files}

Our differential equation is now sufficiently complicated that writing
it out in one line is difficult.  We will need another MATLAB tool to
proceed: a MATLAB function file.


{\bf Syntax} A MATLAB function file
\begin{itemize}
\item has as its first line the form \\
\verb#function ret = f(....)# 
\item \verb#ref# is the {\bf return variable} and must be defined before the end of the function;
\item \verb#f# should be the same as the filename, with the \verb#.m# extension;
\item the \verb#....# can be any list of input variables.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\verb#hypotenuse# that takes in two lengths \verb#a# and \verb#b#, and
returns the length of the hypotenuse for a right-angle triangle with
side lengths $a$ and $b$.

\newpage
\problem Define a new {\bf MATLAB function \texttt{.m} file} called
\verb#springDE# which computes the derivative of
$\ds \frac{d \vec{w}}{dt}$.

\begin{align*}

(i.e. predicted motion) for the system described earlier:

$k = 2 \; \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}$ in an undamped unforced

equilibrium and released.

\topic{Unforced Spring/Mass System - Patterns of Behaviour}
\subsection*{Unforced Spring/Mass System - Patterns of Behaviour}

Using MATLAB, we can now easily study the impact of different levels
of damping on the behaviour of a spring/mass system.

\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_hanging_mass}

A famous result in physics is that when the damping coefficient
\begin{itemize}
\item $c$ is 0, the system will be {\bf undamped};
\item $c$ is {\bf less} than $\sqrt{4km}$, the system will be {\bf under-damped};
\item $c$ is {\bf equal} to $\sqrt{4km}$, the system will be {\bf
    critically damped};
\item $c$ is {\bf greater} than $\sqrt{4km}$, the system will be {\bf
    over-damped};
\end{itemize}

\problem Using a spring constant of $k = 25$ N/m and mass $m = 1$ kg,
find the critical damping level.

\newpage
\problem Use MATLAB to obtain graphs for all four spring/mass cases.

\item mathematical forms of the solutions.
\end{itemize}

Your job during the demonstrations is to track:

What is the form of $y_c$, and what is the form of $y_{NH}$?

More generally, when there is friction in the spring/mass system and
an oscillatory external force, we can break the solution into two
parts: {\em transient} and {\em steady state}.

We set $F_{\mbox{ext}} = 1 \sin(t)$, and $c = 1$ for friction, which is fairly
high for an oscillating system.  Describe the resulting behaviour.

Reminder: we study the simple damped spring/mass system in such depth
because
\begin{itemize}
\item the system displays all the interesting mathematical solution
  forms as we vary just a few parameters, 
\item we hope that the simplicity of the system, and its resemblance
  to familiar systems like swings or bouncing a basket ball, help to
  you associate the mathematics with the real-world behaviour.
\item the DE for the spring/mass system is either identical or similar
  to those for a number of other real-world scenarios, like electronic
  circuits.

\subsection*{Classifying Higher-Order DEs}

While working with DEs in MATLAB, we haven't had to distinguish
between types of equations: so long as they can be re-written in the

solution or prediction.

However, when looking at references or mathematical derivations, where
DEs are solved exactly using by-hand methods, the method used is
usually chosen based on the form of the DE, so being able to
