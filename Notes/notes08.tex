\topic{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System Intro}
\section*{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System}

So far we have seen examples of {\bf first-order DEs}, or equations
with first derivatives of some unknown function.  

In the following examples, we will expand our study to differential
equations with {\bf second or higher derivatives}.

One classic source of differential equations of this type comes from
analyzing the forces on a block at the end of a spring.
\begin{center}

\newpage
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_block}
\end{center}

While the mathematics behind this simple system will be very
interesting in their own right, we should also note at the outset that
the simple spring/mass model can be applied to a wide variety of
not-so-obviously related real-world problems.

\problem In this system, how would you describe $x$ in words?

\newpage
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_block}
\end{center}
\problem Draw a free-body diagram for the mass.  Indicate the magnitude of the forces, assuming 
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the block is $m$ kg, and
\item the spring constant (in $N/m$) is
  given by the constant $k$.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
Let us work with our intuition about this system before beginning the mathematics.

\problem If the spring is very stiff, is $k$ large or small?  \vfill

\newpage {\bf Definition:}: {\em Period} is the length of time to
complete one full cycle/oscillation.  \vspace{0.2in}

\problem If we increase the stiffness of the spring, do you expect the
{\em period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease?  Why?

\vfill

If we increase the mass, do you expect
the \emph{period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease? Why?

\vfill

\newpage

\problem If we know $k$ and $m$, and assume that damping is
negligible, should we be able to determine the exact period of the
oscillations?  \vfill


\vfill

From the work so far, can we easily find the formula for the period?

\vfill

\newpage

The spring system is an excellent introduction to higher-order differential equations because 
\begin{itemize}
\item we all have an intuition about how it \emph{should} work physically,
\item the mathematics and physics are simple, and
\item there's no obvious way to predict critical features (e.g. the
  period) from the given information.
\end{itemize}
We clearly need some new tools!

  whose second derivative is its own negative.  What function(s) would
  satisfy that?  \vfill

\topic{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}
\section*{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}

We now consider an extension to the spring/mass system.

Consider a mass $m$ hanging on the end of a vertical spring; the
spring has a natural length corresponding to $x=0$.  

We have now added a damper, which exerts a force proportional to the
velocity of the oscillating mass.


\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_hanging_mass}

\newpage

\problem Using Newton's second law, build a differential equation that
governs the system.

\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_hanging_mass}


% \begin{itemize}
% \item Gravity acts downward and has a magnitude of $mg$ where $g$ is the
%   acceleration due to gravity; $F_g = mg$.
% \item The spring acts upward and, by Hooke's law, has a magnitude proportional
%   elongation.  If $y$ represents the displacement of the mass from the
%   equilibrium position, then $F_s = -k(\ell +y)$.
% \item Assuming that possible damping forces (i.e.\ a dashpot) are directly
%   proportional to the velocity of the mass, we have $F_d = - cy'$.
% \item There may be an external driving force $F(t)$.
% \end{itemize}
% Summing the forces, we find that $m y'' = F_g + F_s + F_d + F(t) = mg -k(\ell
% +y) -cy' + F(t)$.  At equilibrium, we have $mg = k\ell$ so the standard form of
% the equation is
% \[
% y'' + \tfrac{c}{m} y' + \tfrac{k}{m} y = \tfrac{1}{m} F(t) \, . 
% \]


\newpage
\problem Consider a system with a mass of $0.5 \; \text{kg}$ with
spring constant $k = 2 \; \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}$, with a
damping coefficient of $c = 0.5$ N/(m/s).  Assume the mass is
displaced $0.4 \; \text{m}$ from equilibrium and released.

case?

We set $F_{\mbox{ext}} = 1 \sin(t)$, and $c = 1$ for damping, which is fairly
high for an oscillating system.  Describe the resulting behaviour.

\begin{itemize}
\item the system displays all the interesting mathematical solution
  forms as we vary just a few parameters, 
\item we hope that the simplicity of the system, and its resemblance
  to familiar systems like swings or bouncing a basket ball, help to
  you associate the mathematics with the real-world behaviour.

While working with DEs in MATLAB, we haven't had to distinguish
between types of equations: so long as they can be re-written in the
form $\ds \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$, or the vector form
$\ds \frac{d\vec{w}}{dt} = f(t, \vec{w})$, MATLAB can produce a
numerical solution or prediction. \\[1ex]

However, when looking at references or mathematical derivations, where
DEs are solved exactly using by-hand methods, the method used is
usually chosen based on the form of the DE, so being able to
categorize equations is a helpful skill.
