\topic{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System Intro}
\section*{Second-Order Linear Equations - Spring System}

So far we have seen examples of {\bf first-order DEs}, or equations
with first derivatives of some unknown function.  

From here on in the course, we will study differential equations with
{\bf second or higher derivatives}.

One classic source of differential equations of this type comes from 
analyzing the forces on a block at the end of a spring.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_block}
\end{center}


While the mathematics behind this simple system will be very
interesting in their own right, we should also note at the outset that
the simple spring/mass model can be applied to a wide variety of
not-so-obviously related real-world problems.

In this system, how would you describe $x$ in words?

\newpage
\problem Draw a free-body diagram for the mass.  Indicate the magnitude of the forces, assuming 
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the block is $m$ kg, and
\item the spring constant (in $N/m$) is
  given by the constant $k$.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
Let us work with our intuition about this system before beginning the mathematics.

If the spring is very stiff, is $k$ large or small?
\vfill

\newpage
{\bf Period}: the length of time to complete one full cycle/oscillation.
\vspace{0.2in}

If we increase the stiffness of the spring, do you expect the {\em period} 
of the oscillations to increase or decrease?  Why?

\vfill

If we increase the mass, do you expect
the \emph{period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease? Why?

\vfill

\newpage

If we know $k$ and $m$, and assume that friction is negligible, should
we be able to determine the exact period of the oscillations?  \vfill


\vfill

From the work so far, can we easily find the formula for the period?

\vfill

\newpage

The spring system is an excellent introduction to higher-order differential equations because 
\begin{itemize}
\item we all have an intuition about how it \emph{should} work physically,
\item the mathematics and physics are simple, and
\item there's no obvious way to predict critical features (e.g. the
  period) from the given information.
\end{itemize}
We clearly need some new tools!

\subsection*{Spring System as a DE}

Use Newton's second law, $F = ma$, to construct an equation involving
the position $x(t)$.  \vfill

What order of differential equation does $F=ma$ produce for this
spring/mass system?

\newpage

To simplify matters temporarily, let us assume that both
  $k = 1 $ N/m and $m = 1$ kg. Rewrite the previous differential
  equation.
\vfill

This differential equation invites us to find a function $x(t)$ whose
second derivative is its own negative.  What function(s) would satisfy
that?  \vfill

\topic{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}
\section*{Mechanical Vibrations - Spring-mass system}

We now consider the spring/mass system seen earlier, but with more
detail.

Consider a mass $m$ hanging on the end of a vertical spring of
unstretched length $\ell$.  Using Newton's second law, build a
differential equation that governs the system.

\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{graphics/notes_08_hanging_mass}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Gravity acts downward and has a magnitude of $mg$ where $g$ is the
%   acceleration due to gravity; $F_g = mg$.
% \item The spring acts upward and, by Hooke's law, has a magnitude proportional
%   elongation.  If $y$ represents the displacement of the mass from the
%   equilibrium position, then $F_s = -k(\ell +y)$.
% \item Assuming that possible damping forces (i.e.\ a dashpot) are directly
%   proportional to the velocity of the mass, we have $F_d = - cy'$.
% \item There may be an external driving force $F(t)$.
% \end{itemize}
% Summing the forces, we find that $m y'' = F_g + F_s + F_d + F(t) = mg -k(\ell
% +y) -cy' + F(t)$.  At equilibrium, we have $mg = k\ell$ so the standard form of
% the equation is
% \[
% y'' + \tfrac{c}{m} y' + \tfrac{k}{m} y = \tfrac{1}{m} F(t) \, .

\topic{Nonhomogeneous Linear Differential Equations - Theory}
\section*{Nonhomogeneous Linear Differential Equations}

In the previous lectures, we have learned how to solve linear DEs with
constant coefficients.  Any degree was fine, but the equations had to
be {\bf homogeneous}: \\[2ex]
$$ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + a_{n-2} y^{(n-2)} + \ldots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0$$ \\[2ex]


This week, we explore how to deal with equations with more interesting
right-hand sides.

% \newpage
% \begin{proposition}
%   If $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ are solutions of the \emph{nonhomogeneous} equation
%   \[
%   y'' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = f(x) \, ,
%   \] 
%   then $y_1(x) - y_2(x)$ is a solution to the
%   homogeneous equation $$y'' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = 0$$
% \end{proposition}

% Prove this. 

% \begin{proof}
%   Linearity yields

More generally, when there is friction in the spring/mass system and
an oscillatory external force, we can break the solution into two
parts: {\em transient} and {\em steady state}.

We set $F_{\mbox{ext}} = 1 \sin(t)$, and $c = 1$ for friction, which is fairly
high for an oscillating system.  Describe the resulting behaviour.

\subsection*{Generality of 1st Order Systems}

Out of all the techniques you learned in your DE class, this
transformation of higher-order DEs to systems of first-order ones will
be essential for this class:
\begin{center}
MATLAB solvers like \verb#ode45# {\bf only} handle 1st order
  systems of DEs
\end{center}
In practice, this is not a limitation because:

\vfill 

\newpage

\problem Download the representation of this system of DEs,
  \texttt{pendulumDE.m}.  Compare it to our DE system,
\begin{align*}
\frac{d y_1}{dt} & = y_2 \\
\frac{d y_2}{dt} & = -\frac{g}{L}\sin(y_1)  - \mu y_2
\end{align*}
\vsc

\problem Download and run the script \texttt{W8\_2.m}.

\vsc

\problem What were the initial conditions of the pendulum?

\vfill

\problem Based on that information, what do the two curves on the graph
  represent?

\vfill

\newpage

\problem Change the script so the pendulum also has an initial velocity.

\vsc

\problem If we keep the initial angle at $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ (pendulum
  out horizontally), experiment and find the initial velocity that
  will push the pendulum ``over the top''.

\newpage



\newpage

\subsection*{Vector-based Pendulum Model}
We are now going to model the pendulum's motion as if it were free to
move anywhere in space (two full degrees of freedom).  This will
require a more complicated model, but will be more general (i.e. more
like the roller coaster scenario!)

{\bf Free Body Diagram}
The obvious way to determine how the pendulum would move is to
consider all the forces involved.  For now we will just use gravity
and the rod (no friction).

\problem Draw the free body diagram for the pendulum's mass.
\vfill \vfill

\problem Write out $\Fg$ as a force vector.
\vfill

\newpage
The force $\Fr$ is more complicated.

\problem If the pendulum is at the position $(x, y)$, what is the
  {\bf direction} of $\Fr$?

\vfill

\problem What is the {\bf magnitude} of $\Fr$?

\vfill
\vfill

\newpage 

\problem Write out a formula or calculation to determine $\Fr$,
  given the position $(x, y)$.

\vfill

\newpage


\subsection*{Creating the Differential Equations}

\problem Use Newton's Second Law, $ma = \sum F$, to obtain a
  differential equation for $x$ and another for $y$.

\vfill

\newpage

\problem Using the vector $\vec{w} = [x, x', y, y'] = [w_1, w_2,
  w_3, w_4]$ rewrite our second-order system of DEs for $x$ and $y$ as
  a first-order system for $\vec{w} = [w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4]$.

\subsection*{In MATLAB}
\problem Download the file \texttt{pendulumXYDE.m}.  Complete it by
  computing the values of $\ds \frac{d\vec{w}}{dt} = \vec{w}'$, based
    on the current state, $\vec{w}$.  You are literally transcribing
    the 1st order DE system we just found into MATLAB.

\vsc

\problem Download and run the script \texttt{W8\_3.m}. 
This script simply sets the initial conditions, the time span
for the simulation, then calls \texttt{ode45} to do the simulating.

\vsc

\problem Fix any errors to get the simulation to run.

\vsc

\newpage

\problem The output of the simulation is a vector \texttt{t} and a
  matrix \texttt{w}.  Sketch them and what their contents mean.

\vfill

\newpage

\problem Add the command we used last class, \texttt{plot(t, w)}, 
to the script and re-run the script. 

\vsc

\problem Interpret the graphs produced.

\vfill

\problem Modify the script so that MATLAB shows the path or
  trajectory of the pendulum over the entire simulation.  Comment on
  the quality of the simulation.

\vfill

\newpage


\newpage

\subsection*{Accuracy}
\verb#ode45# generates a {\em numerical approximation} to the real
trajectory.  As soon as we say ``approximation'', we mean ``there is
error''.  Clearly, the default level of error is unacceptable!

\problem Look up the function \texttt{odeset} in MATLAB Help.  Look
  for the key words like `tolerance' and `error'.

\vsc

\problem In \texttt{W8\_3.m}, replace 
\begin{verbatim}
[t, w] = ode45(DE, [0, t_end], w0);
\end{verbatim}
with
\begin{verbatim}
options = odeset('RelTol', 1e-10)
[t, w] = ode45(DE, [0, t_end], w0, options);
\end{verbatim}

\problem Comment on the change in the quality of the simulation.

\vfill

\newpage

\subsection*{Extension Exercises}

\problem Change the static plot into an animation, showing the
  location of the pendulum, as well as the connecting rod and the axis
  of rotation.

\vfill


\problem Change the initial condition to $(x,y) = (-1, 1)$, above the
  axis of rotation and show the resulting trajectory.

\vsc
\vfill

\problem Add an initial {\bf velocity} of 1 m/s to the model.  Hint:
  in what direction must the initial velocity be for a pendulum? 

\vsc
\vfill

\problem Add a friction force to the differential equations.
