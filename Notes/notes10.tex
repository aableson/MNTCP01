\topic{Linear Algebra - Introduction}
\subsection*{Linear Algebra}

As pointed out on several other occasions in the course, most laws
of nature and science, once they are translated into mathematics,
take the form of a {\bf differential equation}.

A differential equation is quite unlike the other equations we have
studied. For one thing, it involves derivatives, often even second
or higher derivatives.  But this is not the most important
difference between a differential equation and the kinds of
equations we have been used to and continue to study in our courses. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Solutions to {\bf algebraic} equations are {\bf real values} (or sets of values) \\[2ex]

\item Solutions to {\bf differential} equations are {\bf functions} (or sets of functions) \\[2ex]

\subsection*{Harmonic Motion} 
We will begin by studying the possible
solutions of a particular differential equation that will be very
important in your Physics course next term. Thinking about these
solutions will help us understand what we mean when we say a function
is a solution of a differential equation.  The differential equation
we saw in the previous concept question arises when we study the
motion of a block at the end of a spring, as in the next diagram:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{graphics/w11_block_pstricks}
\end{center}

 In this system, how would you describe $x$ in words?


\newpage
\begin{problem}
  
 Draw a free-body diagram for the mass.  Indicate the magnitude of the forces, assuming 
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the block is $m$ kg, and
\item the spring constant (in $N/m$) is
  given by the constant $k$.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}


\newpage
Let us work with our intuition about this system before beginning the mathematics.

\begin{problem}
 If the spring is very stiff, is $k$ large or small?
\end{problem}
\vfill

 If we exchange a soft spring for a stiff spring, do you
  expect the \emph{period} of the oscillations to increase or
  decrease? Why?
\vfill


\newpage
\begin{problem}
 If we replace a small mass with a heavier mass, do you expect
the \emph{period} of the oscillations to increase or decrease? Why?
\end{problem}

\vfill

 If we know $k$ and $m$, and assume that friction is
  negligible, should we be able to determine the exact period of the
  oscillations?
\vfill

 Does anyone know the formula for the period of oscillations of a spring system?
\vfill

\newpage

The spring system is an excellent introduction to differential equations because 
\begin{itemize}
\item we all know how it \emph{should} work physically, \\[1ex]
\item the mathematics and physics are simple, {\bf but} \\[1ex]
\item there's no obvious way to predict critical features (e.g. the
  period) from the given information. \\[1ex]
\end{itemize}
We clearly need some new tools!

\topic{Two Formulas for Oscillations}
\subsection*{Two Formulas for Oscillations}

From our solution $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t)$, we get
the sense that the position of the mass attached to a spring will
oscillate at frequency $\omega$ rad/s. But imagining what the sum of a
sine and cosine curve together looks like is not easy: it is a
simple-looking curve or not?  
\\ 
Fortunately, there is another way to
write the solution that is much more easily sketched.

\newpage
A less obvious solution to the DE
$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}= - \omega^2\, x $$
is 
$$x(t)= C\cos(\omega t - \phi)$$

Through the use of the trig identity 
$$\cos(x-y) = \cos(x)\cos(y) + \sin(x)\sin(y)$$ 
we can derive the following relations:

\begin{boxnote}
$$A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) = C \cos(\omega t - \phi) $$
$$\text{where} \quad C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(\phi) = \frac{B}{A}$$
\end{boxnote}

\newpage
$$A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) = C \cos(\omega t - \phi) $$
$$\text{where} \quad C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(\phi) = \frac{B}{A}$$

\begin{problem}
 Prove the equivalency of the two forms, and draw a
  triangle that represents the relationship between all the
  constants.
\end{problem}

\newpage
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.7\linewidth}
$$A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) = C \cos(\omega t - \phi) $$
$$\text{where} \quad C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(\phi) = \frac{B}{A}$$
\end{minipage}

%  Confirm that this is in fact a solution to the spring
%   DE.

%  Are the functions of this form actually different than our earlier
% $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t)$ solutions?

% No: 

% In fact it does not, for we will
% now show that these two only look like different functions, and
% that, using appropriate trigonometric identities, we can show that
% each $B\cos(\omega t) + C\sin(\omega t)$ is identically equal to
% $A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ for suitable $A$ and $\phi$, and
% conversely.

% First of all, you should note that allowing $A$ to be negative in
% the expression $x(t)= A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ amounts to unnecessary duplication, for if
% we add $\pi$ to $\phi$ we change the sign of the expression:
% $$ A\cos(\omega t + \phi +\pi) = -A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
% The reason for this is that $\cos(x+\pi)=-\cos(x)$ for any $x$.
% Thus, we may as well assume that $A$ is chosen to be positive.

% Now there is a trigonometric identity for the cosine of the sum of two angles; it is proved in Appendix D in the textbook if you have not seen it before: $$\cos(a+b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b\,
% . $$ If we apply this with $a=\omega t$ and with $b=\phi$, we obtain
% $$A\cos(\omega t + \phi)= A\left[ \cos(\omega t)\cos(\phi)-\sin(\omega
% t)\sin(\phi)\right]$$
% $$ = [A\cos(\phi)]\cos(\omega t) + [-A\sin(\phi)]\sin(\omega
% t)\, . $$ Notice that $t$ is the only variable in this expression;
% the other letters represent constants.  The question before us is:
% Can $B$ and $C$ be chosen so that this is exactly the same as
% $B\cos(\omega t) + C\sin(\omega t)$ {\bf for all $t$}?  Clearly we can,
% by simply letting %
% \[\begin{array}{lclcl}
% B & = & A\cos(\phi) & = & A\cos(-\phi) \\
% C & = & -A\sin(\phi) & = & A\sin(-\phi)\\
% \end{array}\]

% Conversely, we could ask whether we can always solve for $A$ and
% $\phi$ in terms of $B$ and $C$.  We are not interested in knowing an
% actual formula so much as knowing that it is possible, so that we
% can say with confidence that the two families of solutions we found
% are really one and the same - that for each expression in one family
% there is a corresponding one (defining the same function) in the
% other. To see that this can always be done, suppose a number $\phi$
% and a (positive) number $A$ are given. The we can imagine a line
% segment of length $A$ emanating from the origin and making the angle
% $-\phi$ with the horizontal axis:

% \ques{What are the coordinates of the endpoint of the line segment?}
% \includesoln{\solntest}{\vspace{2cm}}{%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If we drop a perpendicular from the endpoint to the horizontal axis,
% or think of the segment as a vector from the origin to its endpoint,
% it is easy to see that the coordinates of the endpoint are
% $(A\cos(-\phi),A\sin(-\phi))=(A\cos(\phi),-A\sin(\phi))$.

% }%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%  This shows that for any $A$ and any
% $\phi$ the associated numbers $B$ and $C$ are just the coordinates
% of the endpoint of the line segment we drew; and, conversely, if $B$
% and $C$ are given, then we let $A$ be the length of the segment from
% the origin to the point $(B,C)$ and $\phi$ the angle it makes with
% the horizontal axis.  Thus we have shown geometrically that we can
% always solve for $B$ and $C$ if we know $A$ and $\phi$, and
% conversely.


% The upshot of this discussion is that\\

%  \thmbox{The family of functions
% $$B\sin(\omega t) + C\cos(\omega t)\, ,$$
% where $B$ and $C$ are arbitrary constants, and the family of

% By another, rather long, argument it can be shown that there are no
% solutions arising from Hooke's Law, other than the ones in this

% \paragraph{What do these solutions look like?}  We should now describe the functions
% in this family of

% To do this it is easiest to work with the expression
