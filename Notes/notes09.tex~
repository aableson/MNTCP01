\newpage

The physics of how beams deform isn't central to this course, and
engineering students in particular will take a course on structures
that goes into deeper detail.  For our purposes, it is enough to be
able to use the resulting differential equations.

$$EI y^{(4)} = p(x)$$
where  \\
$y(x)$ is the deflection (distance away from a straight line),  \\
$p(x)$ is the loading in N/m at point $x$ along the beam, \\
$E$ is a value related to the material of the beam, and  \\
$I$ is a value derived from the cross-sectional size and shape of the
beam.

\newpage
\problem
  Find the form of $y_c$ for the beam deflection DE, assuming $E$ and
  $I$ are constant.
$$EI y^{(4)} = p(x)$$

\topic{Cantilevered Beam Under Uniform Load} 
\subsection*{Cantilevered Beam Under Uniform Load} 

 Under a uniform loading (constant force per unit length), a {\em
   cantilevered beam} which is $L = 2$ m long, made out of a pine ``2 by 4'' satisfies \\
 $p(x) = 100$ N/m, (or roughly 10 kg applied to each meter) \\
 $I = 2.23 \times 10^{-6}$ m$^4$,\hspace{0.5in} $E = 9.1 \times
 10^{9}$ N/m$^2$,
 
\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/notes_09_CantileveredBeam_Diagram}

and the {\em boundary} conditions 
$y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 0$, $y''(2) = 0$, and $y'''(2) = 0$.

\problem
  Find the amount of deflection of the beam at the tip under this
  load.

\newpage
\hfill $EI y^{(4)} = 100$
 
~\hfill
$y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 0$, 

~\hfill $y''(2) = 0$, and $y'''(2) = 0$.

\newpage
\problem
  If the maximum allowable deflection in such a beam is only 0.2 cm
  (say in a building code), what would the maximum uniform load be?
