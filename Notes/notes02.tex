\topic{Linear Approximations}
\subsection*{Linear Approximations}

You should now feel comfortable in finding the derivative of a wide
variety of functions with formulas. \\[1ex]

In this section, we will explore how the derivatives you can compute
can be tied back to understanding the behaviour of the original
function. \\[1ex]

We will start by returning to the definition of the derivative, based
on the $\ds \frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}$ formula for slopes: 
\begin{align*} 
  f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f = \dfdx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align*} 



\newpage 
For example, if $y = f(x)$, then 
\[ \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = f'(x) 
\]
\begin{problem}
 What is the relationship between $f'$ and $\Delta y$,
	$\Delta x$ for merely {\em small} delta values? 
\end{problem}
\vfill
         Now sketch a graph, and label the two points
        in the $\Delta x$ difference `$x$' and `$a$'.  What expression
        do we obtain for $f(x)$?

\newpage
We want to have a name for the RHS of this approximation:
\begin{boxnote}
\[ L(x)=f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) 
\]
\end{boxnote}
\begin{problem}
 What are some names for this linear function?
\end{problem}


\newpage
\begin{problem}
Consider the tangent line approximation to the graph
of $f(x)=e^x$ at $(0,1)$, where we know that $f^\prime (0) = 1$. 

A good approximation for $e^{0.5}$ is therefore: \\[2ex]
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item $e^{0.5 }\approx 0.5$ \\[2ex]
\item $e^{0.5 }\approx 1+e^{.5}$ \\[2ex]
\item $e^{0.5 }\approx 1+.5$ \\[2ex]
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\topic{Linear Approximations for Error Estimation}
\begin{problem}
  A rock formation with high density ores was identified using gravity
  measurements; the formation is roughly cubic in shape. The edge each
  side of the cube was found to be 370 m, with a possible error in
  measurement of 10 m.  Use the ideas of linear approximations to
  estimate the maximum possible error (positive or negative) in
  computing the {\bf volume} of the formation.
\end{problem}
	\vfill
	\vfill

\newpage
\problem What are the trade-offs of using the linear approximation to
obtain the above error estimate, compared to a direct calculation of
the possible volumes with the error measurements?  \vfill

\topic{The $\sin(x)$ Approximation}
\subsection*{The $\sin(x)$ Approximation}
One of the most commonly-used approximation in physics
is the relationship
\[ \sin(x) \approx x
\]
\begin{problem}

\newpage  Below are more detailed calculations relating
$\sin(x)$ and $x$.  

By filling in some or all of the missing values, determine the range
of angles which the {\em relative error} in the approximation $\sin(x)
\approx x$ is {\bf less than 1\%}. State your answer in degrees and radians.
