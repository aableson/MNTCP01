\topic{Pendulum - Period of Swings}
\subsection*{Pendulum - Period of Swings}

Galileo famously noticed the consistent period of pendulum swings,
even if the amplitude of the swings was changed (so the actual
distance travelled was different).

\vspace{2.5in}

\problem Compare the periods of the pendulum swings, using a range of
initial angles from $\theta_0 = 0.05$ radians up to $\theta_0 = 0.25$
radians ($\approx 14$ degrees).


\newpage
However, it turns out that pendulums are {\bf not} perfectly
consistent in their period, due to the non-linear term
$\ds -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta)$ in one of the forces: as the
amplitudes get bigger, there is a gradual lengthening of the period.


\problem Compare the periods of the pendulum swings, using a range of
initial angles from $\theta_0 = 0.25$ radians up to $\theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$
radians ($= 90$ degrees).

\newpage

\problem Use these observations to explain the designs you see for
pendulum-based clocks.

\topic{Pendulum -  Including an Initial Velocity}
\subsection*{Pendulum -  Including an Initial Velocity}

\problem Write a new simulation script that starts the pendulum
swinging from $ \theta_0 = -\frac{\pi}{2}$, with no initial velocity.
Simulate the motion for this scenario and generate a graph of the
angle against time.

Use the  parameters $g = 9.8$ m/s$^2$, $L$ = 2 m, and $\mu = 0.1$. \\

\vsc

\newpage

If we add a high enough initial `kick', or initial velocity, it would
be possible to make the mass of the pendulum go ``over the top'', or
above the point of rotation.

\problem Sketch what the anglular position graph would look like for
this scenario.

\newpage

\problem If we keep the initial angle at $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ (pendulum
out horizontally), experiment with the MATLAB code to find the initial
velocity that will push the pendulum ``over the top''.

\topic{Application - Lake Mixing Model}
\subsection{Application - Lake Mixing Model}
Consider a small lake that initially contains $10$ million litres of
fresh water.  Water containing an undesirable chemical flows into the
lake at the rate of $5$ million litres per year; the mixture in the
lake flows out at the same rate.  The concentration $c(t)$ of chemical
in the incoming water varies periodically with time according to the
expression $c(t) = 2 + \sin(2t) \; \text{g} \cdot \text{L}^{-1}$.

  \problem Construct a mathematical model of this flow process.

\newpage
\problem Use MATLAB and a differential equation solver to determine
the amount of chemical in the lake over time, assuming that the lake
started without any contamination.

\subsection*{Application - Tailings Pond With Sediment}
% Source: http://faculty.sfasu.edu/judsontw/ode/html/firstlook05.html
Consider a tailings pond, where the the inflow contains both an
environmentally sensitive chemical, and sediments that will settle out
of the water.

\begin{itemize}
\item The volume of the pond is 40,000 cubic meters.
\item Water is flowing in and out of the pond at a rate of 1,500 cubic
  meters per day.
\item The water flowing into the pond contains 2 g of toxic chemical
  per cubic meter.
\item The inflow water also contains 1\% sediments
\end{itemize}

\problem Sketch a diagram of this scenario.

\newpage

\problem Write a differential equation that describes the rate of
change of the concentration of the chemical in the water remaining in
the tailings pond.

that should be addressed to make the model more accurate.
