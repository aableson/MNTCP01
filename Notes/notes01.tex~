\topic{Differentiability}

\section*{Differentiability}


Recall the definition of the derivative. 
\begin{align*} 
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f = \dfdx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align*} 

A function $f$ is {\bf{differentiable}} at a given point $a$ if it has
a derivative at $a$, or the limit above exists.  There is also a
graphical interpretation differentiability: {\bf{if the graph has a
    unique and finite slope at a point}}.  Since the slope in question is
automatically the slope of the tangent line, we could also say that

\begin{quote} {\sc{$f$ is differentiable at $a$ if its graph has a
      (non-vertical) tangent at $(a,f(a))$}}.
\end{quote}

\vfill

For functions of the form $y = f(x)$, we do not consider points with
vertical tangent lines to have a real-valued derivative, because a
vertical line does not have a finite slope.

\vsc
\newpage


Here are the ways in which a function can fail to be differentiable at a point $a$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The function is not continuous at $a$.
\item The function has a corner (or a cusp) at $a$.
\item The function has a vertical tangent at $(a,f(a))$.
\end{enumerate}

\problem Sketch an example graph of each possible case.

Put these properties in decreasing order of stringency,
  and sketch relevant illustrations.

\vfill

\newpage


{\bf Reminder: Differentiability is Common}

You will notice that, despite our concern about some functions {\em
  not} being differentiable, most of our standard functions
(polynomials, rationals, exponentials, logarithms, roots) {\bf are}
differentiable at most points.  Therefore we should investigate what
all these possible derivative/slope values could tell us.

\topic{Computing Derivatives - Basic Formulas}

\section*{Computing Derivatives}
% {\bf Note:} The standard formulas for derivatives are covered in the
% Grade 12 Ontario curriculum. While they will be reviewed here, {\bf
%   students who are not familiar with them should begin both textbook
%   reading and the assignment problems for this unit as soon as
%   possible.}



Beyond the graphical interpretation of derivatives, there are all the
algebraic rules.  {\bf All of these rules} are based on the {\bf definition}
of the derivative,
\begin{align*} 
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f = \dfdx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align*} 

However, by finding common patterns in the derivatives of certain
families of functions, we can compute derivatives much more quickly
than by using the definition.

\topic{Trigonometry Review}

\section*{Trigonometry Review}

In our earlier discussion of functions, we skipped over the
trigonometric functions.  We return to them now to discuss both their
properties and their derivative rules.

\vspace{5mm}

The trigonometric functions are usually defined for students first
using triangles (recall the mnemonic device, ``SOHCAHTOA'').

\vspace{1in}

\newpage

{\bf Extending Trigonometric Domains}

One difficulty with limiting ourselves to the triangle ratio
definition of the trig functions is that the possible angles are
limited to the range $\theta \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ radians or
$\theta \in [0, 90]$ degrees.


To remove this limitation, mathematicians extended the definition of
the trigonometric functions to a wider domain via the unit circle.

% There are two fundamental interpretations of the sine and cosine
% functions, from which all the other trigonometric functions are
% defined:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the point on the unit circle versus an angle
% \item the traditional oscillating graphs   
% \end{itemize}

values in the first quadrant of the unit circle.

particular task.

Having covered the graphs and properties of trigonometric functions,
we can now review the derivative formulae for those same functions.

The derivation of the formulas for the derivatives of $\sin$ and
$\cos$ are an interesting study in both limits and trigonometric
identities.  For those who are interested, many such derivations can
be found on the web\footnote{For example,
  http://www.math.com/tables/derivatives/more/trig.htm\#sin}.
However, it is in some ways more useful to derive the formula in a
graphical manner.
