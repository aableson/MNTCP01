---Question
Are the two vectors \overrightarrow{u} =  \begin{bmatrix} -4\\3\\5 \end{bmatrix} and \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3\\-4 \end{bmatrix} orthogonal? (Hint: Think about how to write a 2 dimensional vector as a three dimensional vector!)

---Answers
=\( Yes, the dot product is zero. \)
~\( Yes, the dot product is not zero.  \)
~\( No, the dot product is zero. \)
~\( Impossible to tell, 2-dimensional vectors can't be compared to three dimensional vectors. \)
