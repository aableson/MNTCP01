When considering the calculation of the rate of heat transfer out of a cooling fin, like
the one seen in this week's videos,
why is an integral needed for the calculation?

---Answers
= Heat flow depends on the temperature of the fin, and the temperature along the fin is not constant.
~ Heat flow depends on the material of the fin, and the conduction along the fin is not constant.
~ Heat flow depends on the surface area of the fin, and the surface area diminishes as you approach the end of the fin.
~ Heat flow depends on the fluid around the fin, and the temperature of the fluid is not constant.

<br />
Assuming a fin is made out of one material, the conduction <it>coefficient</it>
is the constant, so the process of conduction doesn't change.
<br />
Most fins have a constant cross-section and constant surface area <it>per unit of length</it>
so we can't say there is less surface area towards the tip: the statement doesn't really have any meaning. 
<br />

You could make a better case for the temperature of the fluid being
different at different points, but (as we did in the videos) we
typically assume a single constant temperature for the fluid,
\(T_{\infty}\), which is appropriate if the fluid (e.g. air, oil,
water) around the fin is being mixed or it is flowing over the fin.

If you used the <tt>integral</tt> function in MATLAB to
evaluate the integral \(\int_a^b f(x)~dx\), <br />
what basic process is it using to evaluate the integral?

~ The anti-derivative of \(f(x)\)is computed to find \(F(x)\), and then integral limits are then subbed in to compute \(F(b) - F(a)\).
~ The area under the curve is computed through a graph of \(f(x)\), and the resulting area is the integral value.
= The fuction \(f(x)\) is evaluated at many points \(x_i\), then the integral is estimated using formulas similar to \(\sum f(x_i) ~\Delta x\)
---Comment

<br /> When computing integrals by hand or exactly, an anti-derivative
is computed, and the integral limits are then subbed in.  That is not
a numerical approach though, and MATLAB can't be used to compute
anti-derivative functions.

<br /> Numerical calculations are not usually tied directly to graphs,
though graphs can help us understand the idea underlying the
calculation or formula being used.




---Question
You are travelling with velocity \(v(t)\) over the time interval \([a, b]\).
<br />
Your position over that time is given by \(s(t)\).
<br />
Which of the following represent your <b>average velocity</b> over the time interval \([a, b]\)?

~\( \displaystyle \frac{{b-a}}{{s(b) - s(a)}}\)
~\( \displaystyle \frac{1}{{b - a}}\int_a^b s (t)\;dt\)
~\( \displaystyle \frac{{v(b) - v(a)}}{{b - a}}\)
=\( \displaystyle \frac{1}{{b - a}}\int_a^b v (t)\;dt \)
---Comment
<br />
Given the velocity function, you can find the average velocity using the averaging of a function formula: <br />
integral of the velocity, which gives total distance travelled here, divided by the size or length of the time interval, \((b-a)\).
