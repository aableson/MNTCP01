~\( \displaystyle \int x\sin (x)~dx \)
~\( \displaystyle \int \frac{x}{\ln x}~dx \)
~\( \displaystyle \int \sqrt{x} e^{\sqrt{x}}~dx \)
=\( \displaystyle \int x^2(x^3 + 3)^6~dx  \)

(d) - selecting \(w = x^3+3\), dividing by its derivative \((3x^2)\) will cancel the leading \(x^2\).  The new integral will look like \(\displaystyle	\int w^6~dw\) with some constants, which is pretty simple.

(a) can be integrated with a substitution \(w = x^2\).
<br />
(c) has no simple anti-derivative at all, with any method.

~\(\displaystyle x (\ln x)^2~dx \)
~\(\displaystyle x e^{x^3}~dx \)
=\(\displaystyle x \sin(x)~dx \)
~\(\displaystyle \frac{x}{\ln(x)}~dx \)
---Comment
Check the value of \(dv\), and ask whether you are able to integrate it by itself.   If the answer is "no", then that choice of \(dv\) won't help much when using integration by parts.
