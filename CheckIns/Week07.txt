~\( y = e^t \)
~\( y = ke^{kt} \)
=\( y = Ae^{kt} \), where \(A\) is an arbitrary constant.
~\( y = Ae^{t} \), where \(A\) is an arbitrary constant.
---Comment
To verify that a proposed function \(y\) is a solution to an equation, you sub it into the LHS, then the RHS, and check to see whether both sides are equal to each other.

---Question
Given \(\frac{dy}{dt} - \frac{1}{y} + 2 = 0\), and the initial condition \(y(1) = 1\), describe the long term behaviour of the solution to this differential equation.
