We are looking for a graph that is:
<br />
- sloping down (\(f'(x) < 0\)) and
<br />
- concave up (\(f''(x) > 0\)).

Consider the function \( g(x) = e^{3x} \), which has the derivatives
<br />
\(g'(x) = 3 e^{3x} \) and
<br />
\(g''(x) = 9 e^{3x} \).

~ \(P_2(x) = e^{6} + 3 e^{6} (x-6) + \frac{9 e^{6}}{2} (x-6)^2 \)
~ \(P_2(x) = e^{3} + 3 e^{3} (x-2) + \frac{9 e^{3}}{2} (x-2)^2 \)
= \(P_2(x) = e^{6} + 3 e^{6} (x-2) + \frac{9 e^{6}}{2} (x-2)^2 \)
~ \(P_2(x) = e^{3} + 3 e^{3} (x-6) + \frac{9 e^{3}}{2} (x-6)^2 \)

<br />
The formula for a quadratic Taylor polynomial is
<br />
\( P_2(x)  = g(a)  + g'(a) (x-a) + \frac{g''(a)}{2} (x-a)^2 \)
<br />
Given the formulas for \(g(x)\) and its derivatives, the coefficient we need are:
<br />
\( g(2) = e^6 \),  
<br />
\( g'(2) = 3e^6 \),   and
<br />
\( g''(2) = 9e^6 \).
<br />
Each term will be based on a factors of the form \( (x-2) \).

The function is always positive (due to the squared term).  Therefore the function increases towards \(+ \infty\) as \(x \to 1\) (vertical asymptote). As a result, there cannot be a global max on the interval, because the function increases forever towards the asymptote.
<br />
On the end points though, there will be a (global) minimum of the function reached.

Note that the rule about a function always having a global max or min on a closed interval does <b>not</b> apply here, because the function in that theorem <b>must be continuous on the interval</b>.  With the vertical asymptote at \(x=1\), \(f(x)\) is not continuous on the interval given, so the theorem doesn't apply.
