---Question
To generate a solution for (or simulate the behaviour of) the pendulum
in MATLAB, where the torque equations give us the differential equation 
<br />
\( \theta''  = -a_1 \sin(\theta) - a_2 \theta' \),
<br />
what standard substitution would be used to create a new system of first-order DEs?

~ We let \(w_1 = t, w_2 = 1\).
~ We let \(w_1 = \sin(\theta), w_2 = \theta' \).
= We let \(w_1 = \theta, w_2 = \theta' \).
~ We let \(w_1 = \theta, w_2 = 1 \).

<br />
The standard substitution has to be about the <b>dependent
variable</b> and its derivative.  We don't do any transformations
of the variables in this step.

In the pendulum example, experimenting with trying to find the
velocity that would push the pendulum "over the top", what was the
<b>only</b> thing that was changed in the MATLAB code during the
experiment?

~ The differential equation variables.
~ The differential equation constants or parameters.
~ The time span.
= The initial conditions.
---Comment

We were experimenting with different <b>initial</b> angular velocities,
to see how quickly the pendulum had to be moving to push itself over the top.
<br />
The physical rules (Newton's 2nd Law) didn't change, so that meant that the differential
equation would not change during the experiment.


---Question
In the mixing model examples, when we converted from quantities \(Q\) to concentrations \(C\), there were two forms seen for the derivative relationship:
<br />
(a) \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{dQ}{dt} \)
<br /> and
<br />
(b) \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{\frac{dQ}{dt} V - Q \frac{dV}{dt}}{V^2} \)
<br />

~ Form (a) was correct for changing water volumes, while (b) was correct for constant water volumes.
= Form (a) was correct for constant water volumes, while (b) was correct for changing water volumes.
~ Form (a) was correct for changing chemical amounts, while (b) was correct for constant chemical amounts.
~ Form (a) was correct for constant chemical amounts, while (b) was correct for changing chemical amounts.

In all cases, the relationship between concentration and amounts is given by
<br />
\(\displaystyle C = \frac{Q}{V}\)
<br />
The difference arises when you differentiate both sides.   \(C\) and \(Q\) are always changing, but <br />
if the volume \(V\) is constant, then the RHS derivative is simply (a) \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{dQ}{dt} \)
<br />
If the volume is changing with time though, we need to use the product rules, which gives 
(b) \(\displaystyle \frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{\frac{dQ}{dt} V - Q \frac{dV}{dt}}{V^2} \).
