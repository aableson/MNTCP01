For the graph defined by \(y = 2x^3 - x\), which of the following
would be the tangent line to the graph at \(x=1\)?

---Answers
~ \(y = 6x^2 - 1\)
~ \(y = (6x^2 - 1)(x-1) + 1\)
~ \(y = (6 - 1)(x-1) + 1\)
---Comment
To compute the formula for the tangent line, we use
<br />
\(f(x) = 2 x^3 - x\) and its derivative
<br />
\(f'(x) = 6 x^2 - 1\).
<br />
These need to be evaluated at the point \(a=1\), and then we are
ready to use our linearization formula,
<br />
\(y = f'(a) (x-a) + f(a)\)
