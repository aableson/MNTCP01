One feature: from \(x=-0.3\)-ish onwards, the function is always <em>increasing</em>, or has <em>positive slopes</em>.
<br />
Therefore the \(f'(x)\) values for \(x > - 0.3\)  point must always be <b>positive</b>.
<br />
Other reference points: look for slope=0 points in the original graph, and map them 
to zero <b>y-values</b> on the \(f'(x)\) graph (i.e. at \(x=-1.2, -0.3\)).
