
Week 6 practice problems need some beefing up, specifically with:
- more application problems, and
- questions that involve loading a dataset.

Week 8 - Webwork
I had a folder called 
MNTC/MATLAB_09_TemperatureAndSpringModels/
q_001.pg is a good problem on temperature models, but I also started
q_002.pg on the spring model.  I didn't get it finished though because I was trying
to get the exact solution built into Webwork and that was a royal pain. It really should be there as either an optional 4th question, or a 5th question (to force students to get the systems of DEs work in MATLAB).
